## 📖 Description

This project is a solution to the **Frontend Mentor – Product list with cart** challenge.

The goal of this project is to build a responsive product listing page with a fully functional shopping cart using **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, matching the provided design as closely as possible.

All product data is dynamically loaded from a local `data.json` file.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Users should be able to:

- Add products to the cart
- Increase and decrease product quantities
- Remove products from the cart
- See an order confirmation modal after clicking **Confirm Order**
- Reset the cart and start a new order
- View an optimal layout across different screen sizes
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements

## ⚙️ Features & Implementation Details

- Product data is fetched asynchronously from `data.json`
- Cart state is managed using a **Map object** to prevent duplicate products
- Each product stores its own `quantity` value inside the cart state
- UI updates are synchronized between:
  - Product list
  - Cart sidebar
  - Order confirmation modal
- Fully responsive layout using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**
- Modal confirmation screen with order summary
- Clean separation between UI rendering and state logic

---
